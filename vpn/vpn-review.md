# RedShield VPN
https://redshieldvpn.xyz/en  
There is no free version as of July 11, 2025, but the paid 
version does not limit internet speed at all. My current speed  
on the VPN is 80 Mbps. Another advantage of this VPN is  
the availability of several ways to use the subscription:  
- WireGuard tunnel;  
- RedShield VPN extension for browsers;  
- via OpenVPN;  
- Linux/Windows/macOS/Android apps.  

I spent 3 hours trying to find a decent free VPN. I tried  
several browser extensions (ProtonVPN, AdGuard VPN),  
but their free versions worked very, very slowly.  

As a result, I don't want to return to free VPNs  
because it's a waste of time reconnecting and searching  
for other VPNs. Also, I'm not sure that the security  
of free VPNs is sufficient.
